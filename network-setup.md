## Network requirements
_Your blackbox is plug and play with the correct network setup. The following are required:
* An always on, high speed internet connection
* Local ethernet network that does not require a whitelist
* Port 1194 open to allow OpenVPN connections

_An always on internet connection is essential for your blackbox units. They communicate with our centralised cloud infrastructure to stitch and save your data for easy access.

## Unit setup
_These parameters will need be entered into the config page on your black.ai portal
_An origin point in the observation space will need to be defined. Your blackbox units will need to be positioned around the observation space relative to this point and the following data recorded:
* Camera position (x and y coordinates in meters). This is relative to your origin point
* Camera height (in meters)
* Camera angle (this is the tilt down from horizontal in degrees)
* World camera angle (counter clockwise rotation from the positive y axis on the world map in degrees)

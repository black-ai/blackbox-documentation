# Code Example: Python #
version 0.0.1

### What is this this example application for? ###
This repository includes client side software to enable a roomba robot, with assistance from a Blackbox websocket endpoint, to navigate through a space and follow a target person track. 

### How do I get set up? ###

    git clone https://bitbucket.org/tgsmiles/roomba-bot.git

This code is designed to be run on a raspberry pi 3 connected to a roomba via USB to the serial port on the roomba.

##### Configuration:
In black_report_client.py set the websocket address to the remote ip of your blackbox websocket endpoint
    eg: 
    
    WEBSOCKETADDR = "ws://13.x.x.xx:55955"
		
##### Dependencies:
*	scipy
*   skimage
*   websocket
	
##### How to run tests:
To calibrate the roombaâ€™s wheel discrepancy so that it drives as straight run $ python drive_test.py. This will attempt to drive the roomba straight for 1.5 meters. In robot.py, modify DEFAULT_WHEEL(LR) to change the default wheel speeds of both the left and right wheels, to compensate for any unintended turning that have occurred. Once you have the roomba driving as straight as possible, measure the distance it moved. If it is not 2 meters, adjust TIME_FAC, also in robot.py, increasing if it was less than 2 meters and decreasing if it was more than 2 meters. 


##### Deployment instructions:
Once the roomba has been calibrated and websocket server is running run $ python black_report_client.py and the roomba will follow 
    the first track it is given by the server.

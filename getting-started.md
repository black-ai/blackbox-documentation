## Getting Started

**Please note:**
Account registration is currently limited to a small number of early partners, but will be open to the public soon. If you are a member of a research institution across the Asia-Pacific region or North America, and are interested in beta testing or piloting the system, please contact us at [contact@black.ai](mailto:contact@black.ai)

To use the Blackbox system you will need to purchase a small number of Blackbox inference units from our webshop at [https://black.ai/checkout](https://black.ai/checkout).

Please refer to the next two sections which cover setup requirements and instructions.

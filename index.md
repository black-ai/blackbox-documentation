## Welcome to the Blackbox Documentation
The Blackbox system makes it quick and easy to deploy and scale autonomous systems in any unpredictable physical environment. Whether you prefer programming in Python or Javascript, or getting your hands dirty with C++ and raw sockets, Blackbox enables you to build your complex systems faster, without worrying about the complexity of cutting-edge computer vision. You can focus on solving real world problems, while Blackbox takes care of the rest. 

These documents cover how to set up, configure and optimise autonomous applications with the Blackbox sensor system. The documentation is broken up into sections which are listed in the sidebar.
